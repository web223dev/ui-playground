- */includes/archive-header.php* will output category/tag description if it exists.


### Images

- Removed default WordPress 'medium_large' image size - other defaults can be removed by uncommenting
- Function added to allow SVG image uploads to Media Library.
- Image uploads add their file name as alt and title attributes


### Custom Logo
- Custom Logo is supported via the Customizer in the panel Settings > Site Identity > Logo, default size is 300x100px which you can change in the *add_theme_support('custom-logo')* array in *functions.php*
- The logo can support the SVG format.
- SVGs are set to be allowed for upload by the constant 'ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS' declared in *functions.php*
- The main purpose of the Custom Logo is to allow for its use via a header created with Beaver Themer - if you are using the Beaver Theme to create the header then the default Header panel > Header Logo section is preferred to use.
